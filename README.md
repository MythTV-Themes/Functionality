Functionality is a mythtv theme with a 14 channel 4 hour program guide.
The menu options are all on one screen so you don't have to scroll to see all of them.
It is based on the Mythbuntu 28.21 theme, so should work on any version mythtv it works on.
That should include at least versions 27 through 30 although the guide selector may have
issues with versions earlier than 29.1, but it will still function.
To install, simply download and then unpack in your ~/.mythtv/themes directory.
You can then choose it with the theme chooser.
